# Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Analysis

This is a repo for a course at the Department of Cosmic Research, MSU. The course covers the very basic concepts of ML, it will be obligatory for 4th year students, but in 2020 it is an elective course.

# General info
The course consists of 11-12 lectures and seminars and 5-6 homeworks.
There will be several types of hw:
- Theoretical (classical problem solving with pen and paper)
- Practical (Jupyther Notebooks)
- Kaggle competitions
